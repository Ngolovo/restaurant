            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>Homeland Restaurant was founded in 2010 in the heart of Food City, born from a passion for sharing East African culinary traditions with a global flair. Inspired by the vibrant flavors of Kenya, Tanzania, and Nigeria, our founders set out to create a welcoming space where fresh, locally sourced ingredients transform into dishes that tell a story of heritage and community. From humble beginnings, we’ve grown into a beloved dining destination, known for our signature Mandazi, Bhajias, and Moi Moi, each crafted with care to honor authentic recipes. Over the years, our commitment to quality and hospitality has earned us a loyal following, making Homeland a place where families, friends, and food lovers gather to celebrate. Today, we continue to innovate while staying true to our roots, offering a menu that blends tradition with creativity, ensuring every visit feels like coming home.
